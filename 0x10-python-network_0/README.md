# 0x10. Python - Network #0

## Description
This project focuses on learning and implementing various concepts related to network programming using Python and Bash scripting. It covers topics such as HTTP, API interactions, and server communication.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will gain understanding in:
- What a URL is and how to read it
- Basics of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- HTTP request methods and response status codes
- HTTP headers and message body
- HTTP Cookies and their usage
- Making HTTP requests using cURL
- Application-level interactions when typing a URL in a browser

## Repository Contents
The project contains several tasks, each aimed at implementing specific functionalities using Bash and Python scripts:
- Task 0: cURL body size
- Task 1: cURL to the end
- Task 2: cURL Method
- Task 3: cURL only methods
- Task 4: cURL headers
- Task 5: cURL POST parameters
- Task 6: Find a peak (Technical interview preparation)

## Requirements
- All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Bash scripts are exactly 3 lines long and must be executable with `#!/bin/bash` at the beginning
- Python scripts are interpreted using `python3` (version 3.8.5) and must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code adheres to PEP8 style guidelines (`pycodestyle` version 2.8.*)
- Proper documentation for all modules, classes, and functions

## Usage
Each script is designed to perform a specific task related to network interactions and HTTP requests. Scripts can be executed with appropriate arguments to test against the provided sandbox environment.
