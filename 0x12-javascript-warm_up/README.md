#  0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
## JavaScript

   - JavaScript is used for many things. Here,
   you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

       * Scripting (same as we did with Python)
       * Web front-end

   - For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this
   language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our
   AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
